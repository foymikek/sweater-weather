        middle homes, like ADUs, backyard cottages, mother-in-law suites, duplexes,
        triplexes, low-rise apartments or townhouses, have long fit into urban neighborhoods,
        often providing rental and purchase options more affordable than single-detached
        houses. Sightline''s Modest Middle Homes Library is a resource for abundant
        housing advocates, urbanists, planners, and journalists. All our photos are
        free to use. We will continue to add more and we invite you to share your
